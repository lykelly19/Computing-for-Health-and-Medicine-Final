## Overview:
Our goal was to create a model to efficiently and accurately detect the severity of DR in eye images to avoid manual classification by clinicians. We were able to pre-process, augment and split eye images into 4 quadrants. We created Quadrant Based Ensemble Inception V3 (instead of V2) models for each quadrant. We trained and tested the model to detect the severity of DR in eye images.
